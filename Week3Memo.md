Cook, Katherine. 2018 Negotiating Memory: Funerary Commemoration as Social Change in Barbados. African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal.

Anglican church commemoration in Barbados originally reflected white, British history but was gradually appropriated by freed Black communities post-emancipation.

Funerary monuments served as tools to negotiate memory, social structures, and community relationships, subverting racial and religious hierarchies.

Barbados was heavily populated during slavery, resulting in high mortality rates and the island being described as a “vast burial ground.”

Enslaved Africans were largely excluded from Anglican churches and main burial grounds, with most buried in plantation cemeteries near slave villages.s

Baptism and church involvement increased among African-Barbadians in the 19th century, yet burial in Anglican churchyards remained limited due to social and racial restrictions.

Early pre-emancipation monuments for free persons of color were rare, sporadic, and mostly commemorated women and children, often reflecting British styles.

Post-emancipation, African-Barbadians increasingly used Anglican burial grounds, with more elaborate monuments signaling social status and asserting community presence (e.g., Samuel Jackman Prescod).

Monument materials adapted to economic realities: poured concrete, coral stone, and prefabricated blocks mimicked traditional stone markers.

Commemorative practices evolved into heritage practices in the 20th century, reflecting ongoing memory, racial, and social negotiations, often linked to tourism and cultural recognition.

Analysis of monuments provides insights into the interplay of colonization, decolonization, race, religion, and social identity in Barbados, revealing resistance and self-representation previously underrepresented in historical records.



Pillatt, Toby. et al. 2020 The Burial Space Research Database (Data Paper), Internet Archaeology 55

Purpose of the Database: Central repository for systematic archaeological surveys of burial spaces, enabling local and community groups to share findings and publish results.

Geographic Coverage: Currently includes sites in England and the Isle of Man, with potential for expansion.

Standardisation: Uses a consistent methodology and vocabulary to make datasets interoperable, allowing comparisons across sites and projects.

Data Focus: Captures both human-related data (names, dates, relationships) and material aspects of monuments (shape, material, condition, decoration, tooling marks).

Database Structure: Includes site metadata (location, survey dates, researchers), memorial-specific data, individual records, and OASIS ID for cross-platform linking.

Minimum Requirements for Data:

Required: site metadata, site plan with numbered memorials, per-memorial survey data.

Recommended: broad type, date, condition, measurements (for monuments); names, age at death, date of death (for people).

Search Interface: Text-based and image-based searches for memorials and individuals; supports complex queries and cross-referencing via downloadable CSV files.

Research and Use Cases: Can study commemoration trends, monumental forms, symbolism of death, genealogical connections, societal trends, and regional or temporal differences.

Community Involvement: Recording burial spaces is popular with volunteers; the database supports training and encourages consistent, high-quality recording.

Significance and Impact: Provides a sustainable, open-access platform for heritage management, comparative analysis, monitoring gravestone condition, and inspiring new research in both archaeology and family history.



Baxter, Jane Eva. 2020. Emotional Practice and Emotional Archaeology- A Perspective from the Archaeology of Childhood in Kisha Supernant, Jane Eva Baxter, Natasha Lyons, Sonya Atalay (eds). Archaeologies of the Heart, Springer, Cham.


Heart-centered archaeology: Connects the researcher’s whole self to their work; challenges the traditional detached, materialist approach. Personal connectedness can strengthen research.

Traditional American archaeology training: Emphasized scientific, materialist methods; intangible aspects of culture and emotions were often disregarded.

Focus on children: Baxter’s dissertation challenged the idea that children were unimportant in past societies. Early work was scientific and statistical, aiming to show children could be identified archaeologically.

Child-free personal choice: Baxter links her personal choice to be child-free with her scholarly interest in childhood, challenging assumptions that studying children requires having them.

Cultural context: Contemporary American society places high emotional, social, and economic value on children; historical archaeology often overlooks this emotional dimension.

Archaeology of emotions: Emergent field exploring emotional lives of past people; emphasizes group emotional sensibilities rather than projecting modern emotions onto individuals.

Emotional communities: Concept from Rosenwein; groups sharing, tolerating, and defining emotional expressions. Individuals can belong to multiple emotional communities, shaped by social and cultural contexts.

Evocative archaeological spaces: Cemeteries and ritual contexts elicit emotions; mortuary archaeology and commemorative practices can reveal grief, care, and love.

19th-century American rural garden cemeteries: Designed landscapes for contemplation, socialization, and expressing grief; children’s monuments reflect family investment, love, and social status.

Parental grief and emotion: Mortality rates influenced parental care and expressions of grief; commemorative practices for children illustrate both material/social investment and emotional attachment.

Material vs emotional interpretation: Archaeology can analyze socioeconomic status, identity, and symbolism from monuments, but integrating emotion offers a fuller understanding of past human experience.

Integration of emotion in practice: Emotional awareness and reflexivity in archaeological research enrich understanding of both past and present human experiences.
