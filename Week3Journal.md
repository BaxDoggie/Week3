"The desire to explore topics that amplify the humanity of archaeological subjects, the need to acknowledge and value non-archaeological ways of knowing the past, and the demand for alternative ways of communicating archaeological findings are all rooted in a dissatisfaction with an archaeology that denies the humanity of people in the past and therefore, in a way, our own too."

Thinking about it, I can see how my work this week ties into highlighting the humanity of the people buried in the cemetery. Even though I was using structured classifications and mapping tools, I still had to make judgment calls to represent each grave respectfully and accurately. Sometimes forcing graves into strict categories felt like it might erase their individual stories. Working with the photos, sketching the map, and building the webmap gave me a way to show more of the personal and visual side of the cemetery, even if the system couldn’t capture every detail.

Using the debs.ac.uk classification was both helpful and frustrating. It gave me a clear system to follow, but sometimes the graves didn’t really fit into one category. I felt like the uniqueness of some memorials was being lost when I had to force them into the codes.

This week I finished adding graves to Kobotoolbox. That part went fine, but I struggled at times with choosing the right classification since a lot of the memorials didn’t perfectly match the options. I also caught up on my sketch map since I only found this graveyard late last week, so I hadn’t had the chance to do it before. I organized all of my photos for our future 3D modeling, so it will be easier when that time comes. I’m looking forward to learning that process as a new way of showing the information we’ve collected. On top of that, I built a webmap that included both a regular and satellite base layer, with photos linked to each pin. Getting the photos onto the map was fun, but some Google Maps coordinates didn’t line up properly, so I had to manually adjust them. Even though it was a bit of extra work, I enjoyed it since I haven’t done much HTML before, and it was satisfying to see everything come together. Working on the mapping also made me realize how much control I had over how the graveyard is presented — the layers, the images, and the placement decisions all shape what others will see and how they’ll understand the space.
